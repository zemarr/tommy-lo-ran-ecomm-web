## Photography Direction

### Image Lighting & Tone
- **Natural light** primary source—soft, diffused, golden hour preferred
- **Earth tones** dominate the palette: ochres, terracottas, warm grays
- **Mix of locations**: studio + outdoor African settings
- **Textured backgrounds**: mud walls, woven textures, weathered surfaces, architectural elements
- **High contrast subtle**—celebrate depth and dimension

### Environment & Architecture
- African architectural elements (arches, columns, traditional structures)
- Natural materials (wood, stone, clay, textiles)
- Organic backgrounds that complement clothing, not compete
- Studio: minimalist, neutral tones
- Outdoor: authentic cultural settings with cultural integrity

### Celebrating Brown Skin
- Clothing colors and lighting chosen to honor skin tones
- No filters that desaturate or cool skin
- Focus on texture and luminosity
- Lighting emphasis on facial features and garment detail
- Avoid high-key overexposure that washes out depth

## Model Styling & Posing

### Posture & Attitude
- **Calm, meditative poses**—editorial not influencer
- **Strong, grounded posture**—confidence without aggression
- **No forced smiles**—natural expressions, neutral or knowing gaze
- **Stillness valued over movement**
- **Introspective energy**—models look within, not at camera

### Cultural Props & Accessories
- **Chairs**: wooden stools, traditional seating (Moroccan pouf, West African carved stool)
- **Textiles**: indigo cloth, kente, mudcloth backdrops
- **Objects**: ceremonial items, cultural artifacts (when appropriate)
- **Accessories**: minimal jewelry with cultural significance
- **Styling**: reflects heritage without appropriation—intentional, respectful

### Composition
- **Negative space essential**—breathing room around figure
- **Rule of thirds** with emphasis on garment detail
- **Close-ups** of stitching, fabric, hands
- **Wide shots** showing silhouette + environment connection
- **Details**: buttons, seams, hand-tailored elements highlighted

---

## Editorial Reference
Inspiration drawn from:
- **Vogue Africa**: sophisticated, culturally grounded, high production
- **Nataal**: celebrates African designers, intentional storytelling
- **The Folklore**: poetic, editorial, cultural reverence
- **Common thread**: celebration, not exoticization; heritage as foundation
